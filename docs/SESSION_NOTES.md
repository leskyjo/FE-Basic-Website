# Session Checkpoint - 2026-01-19

## Accomplished
- Explored entire codebase to determine project identity
- Discovered this is the FULL Felon Entrepreneur web app (Next.js + Supabase + OpenAI), NOT a simple Apple compliance landing page
- Initialized git repository and connected to GitHub (leskyjo/FE-Basic-Website)
- Committed and pushed all 213 files to GitHub
- Created session documentation

## Decisions Made
- Confirmed this project has Apple App Store deployment planned (via Capacitor) but is NOT a simple landing page
- Connected to existing GitHub repo `FE-Basic-Website` despite the name mismatch
- No Netlify configuration exists locally - deployment status unknown

## Open Tasks
- [ ] Determine if a SEPARATE Apple compliance landing page exists elsewhere on the system
- [ ] Check Netlify dashboard to see if this repo is connected for deployment
- [ ] Consider renaming GitHub repo from "FE-Basic-Website" to something more accurate
- [ ] Locate or create actual Apple developer account compliance landing page if needed
- [ ] Continue development on the main FE platform

## Files Modified
- `SESSION_NOTES_2026-01-19.md` (created - detailed session notes at root level)
- `docs/SESSION_NOTES.md` (created - this checkpoint file)
- All 213 project files committed to git (initial commit)

## Context for Next Session
We were investigating whether this project was the Apple compliance landing page for the developer account. It's NOT - this is the full Felon Entrepreneur web application platform. The project is now properly connected to GitHub at leskyjo/FE-Basic-Website. Next session should clarify: (1) where the actual Apple compliance landing page is (or if one needs to be created), (2) check Netlify dashboard for deployment status, and (3) decide what development work to continue on the main FE platform.
