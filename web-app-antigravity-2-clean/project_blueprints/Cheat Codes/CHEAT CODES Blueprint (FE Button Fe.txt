CHEAT CODES Blueprint (FE Button Feature)
1. Purpose and Positioning

Cheat Codes is a monetized micro-content library of high-value “life hacks” delivered as short videos. Content can be created by:

Kyle and Nate (primary creators)

Approved community creators (secondary creators)

AI-generated videos featuring Kyle/Nate (only if you choose to support that workflow)

Cheat Codes lives inside the FE Button (center hub). It is listed under the Courses area as its own dedicated card/module, and it can open into its own full page/section.

Core value proposition:

Low-ticket, impulse-buy videos ($2–$10 each)

Immediately actionable advice (practical life wins)

Easy discovery and purchase inside the FE Button hub

2. Information Architecture (IA) and Navigation
2.1 Entry Points

Mobile (primary):

User taps FE Button (center glowing button in bottom navigation)

FE Button opens the FE Hub panel / modal page

Under the Courses grouping, user sees a Cheat Codes card

Desktop/Tablet:

FE Button equivalent entry (button in UI, or FE Hub menu item)

Same structure: FE Hub → Courses grouping → Cheat Codes

2.2 Locations

Cheat Codes can exist in both:

FE Hub module view (quick browse, featured content)

Dedicated Cheat Codes page (full catalog and filters)

Recommended routes:

FE Hub: /fe (or modal state)

Cheat Codes main: /fe/cheat-codes

Cheat Code detail: /fe/cheat-codes/[slug-or-id]

3.3 Cheat Code Detail Page

Layout:

Video header area with a player

Title + creator + category + price

Teaser playback always available (free)

Locked full video requires purchase

Key UI elements:

“What you’ll learn” bullet list

“Who it’s for” quick tags

Upsell:

“Buy 3 Cheat Codes, save 10%” (optional later)

“Related Cheat Codes” carousel

4. Purchase and Access Rules
4.1 Pricing

Each video is individually priced: $2 to $10

Price is stored per video item and can change for future items

4.2 Ownership Model

Purchases unlock per-video access

Owned videos become permanently available to the purchaser (unless you later define license terms)

4.3 Teaser vs Full Video

Teaser is always watchable without payment (or optionally requires account to reduce abuse)

Full video is gated behind purchase

4.4 Logged-Out Users

Two acceptable patterns (choose one; recommended is #2):

Allow browsing + teaser viewing; purchase requires signup/login.

Allow browsing only; teaser + purchase requires signup/login. (recommended for fraud reduction and clean tracking)

6. Data Model and Database Requirements
6.1 Tables
cheat_codes

id (uuid, primary)

title (text)

slug (text, unique)

description (text)

teaser_url (text) — public teaser video

full_video_url (text) — gated video

thumbnail_url (text)

duration_seconds (int)

price_cents (int) — e.g., 200–1000

currency (text, default “USD”)

creator_type (enum: kyle, nate, community, ai)

creator_profile_id (uuid nullable; for community creators)

category (text or FK to categories table)

tags (text[] optional)

status (enum: draft, pending, published, unlisted, removed)

created_at, updated_at

cheat_code_purchases

id (uuid)

user_id (uuid, FK to auth user)

cheat_code_id (uuid, FK)

price_cents_at_purchase (int)

currency (text)

payment_provider (text: stripe, etc.)

payment_intent_id (text)

purchase_status (enum: pending, paid, refunded, chargeback)

created_at

cheat_code_access

(You can also derive access from purchases, but a dedicated table is useful for performance and refunds)

user_id

cheat_code_id

access_status (enum: active, revoked)

revoked_reason (text nullable)

created_at, updated_at

cheat_code_views

(optional analytics)

id

user_id nullable (for logged-out teaser)

cheat_code_id

view_type (enum: teaser, full)

watched_seconds

created_at

6.2 RLS (Row Level Security) Rules

Users can read cheat_codes where status = published (public read)

Users can read their own cheat_code_purchases and cheat_code_access

Full video URL should not be exposed directly to unauthorized users:

Best practice: store full video in private storage and serve via signed URLs

7. Payments and Delivery (Functional Requirements)
7.1 Payment Provider

Recommended: Stripe

Create a Checkout flow or Payment Intent flow

On successful payment:

record purchase

set cheat_code_access.active

unlock full video

7.2 Refunds / Chargebacks

If refunded or chargeback:

set purchase status

revoke access (access_status = revoked)

full video should no longer load

7.3 Video Hosting

Recommended approach:

Store videos in a bucket (private for full videos, public for teasers)

Use signed URLs for full videos

Throttle repeated requests

8. Security, Anti-Abuse, and Compliance
8.1 Prevent Full Video Leakage

Do not put full video direct URLs into the page HTML for non-owners

Use a backend endpoint that checks access and returns a short-lived signed URL

8.2 Rate Limiting

Rate-limit teaser playback requests

Rate-limit signed URL generation endpoints

8.3 Purchase Integrity

Only trust Stripe webhook confirmation for “paid”

Never grant access based only on frontend “success” state

8.4 Content Authenticity

For AI-generated videos “featuring” real people:

Require internal approval before publishing

Label as AI clearly in the UI

Keep a policy / disclaimer page
