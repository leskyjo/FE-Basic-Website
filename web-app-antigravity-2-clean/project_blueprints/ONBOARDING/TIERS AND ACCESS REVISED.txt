TIERS AND ACCESS REVISED


Felon Entrepreneur — Final Tier & Access Blueprint

(Front-End, Back-End, Database, Security, Email/Notifications, Settings)

Version: Architect-Approved / Conflict-Resolved Draft

1. Purpose of this blueprint

This blueprint defines the exact, enforceable rules governing tiered access and usage across the entire Felon Entrepreneur application.

This document establishes:

Tier definitions and access states (Starter, Trial, Plus, Pro)

What each tier can and cannot do

How users gain access to paid functionality

How users start, cancel, downgrade, or upgrade access at any time

How trial behavior works end-to-end

How usage limits are enforced server-side

What database structures are required to support enforcement and auditing

What security controls are mandatory to prevent tampering or abuse

What emails and notifications must be triggered during tier changes, limits, and billing events

What settings must exist to allow users to manage subscriptions and notifications

This document is written so it can be used to derive implementation-ready build prompts for:

Front-end UI and gating behavior

Back-end API and RPC enforcement logic

Database schema and RLS (row-level security) policies

Security and anti-abuse controls

Email and notification templates and trigger rules

This blueprint is the authoritative source of truth for all tier and access behavior. All other feature blueprints must conform to it.

2. Established tier package prices (locked)

Starter
Free

Plus
$15 per month

Pro
$25 per month

ProLite 7-Day Trial
Free for 7 days with a submitted and approved payment method

3. Key product rules (locked)
3.1 Universal AI Coach

There is one universal AI coach experience throughout the application.

The AI coach is only visible on AI-enabled pages after onboarding is complete.

The AI coach may reference:

The user’s Life Plan

Jobs activity and saved jobs

Courses and resources

Previously purchased tools

Resume or application context only when explicitly allowed by tier

The AI coach must never appear:

On the public landing page

On signup or login pages

During any onboarding step

All AI requests must be routed through server-side endpoints. The client must never call AI providers directly.

3.2 AI availability timing

AI is not available until after account creation and onboarding completion.

No AI on landing pages

No AI on signup or login

No AI during onboarding steps

AI becomes available only once onboarding is complete and the user is inside the authenticated application experience.

3.3 Premium tools

The Resume Builder is considered the highest abuse-risk tool due to its high-value output and is tightly gated.

The Application Assistant is also valuable but is safer to preview with limited sampling to support conversion.

3.4 Weekly Starter refresh

Starter AI credits refresh every 7 days.

Starter users also receive one Application Assistant sample use as part of their initial “getting started” experience.

4. Tier states (simple and enforceable)

A user is always in exactly one tier state:

Starter (Free)

Trial (7-Day ProLite universal trial)

Plus (Paid)

Pro (Paid)

The Trial tier is a distinct state. It is not a “Plus trial” or “Pro trial.”

Tier state must always be derived from server-side data and billing webhooks.

5. Clarified lifecycle and state transitions

This section defines how tier transitions work in real-world usage.

5.1 New account creation

When a user creates an account:

tier is set to starter

The user may be shown upgrade messaging during signup, but they are technically created as Starter until billing is completed

The user receives:

10 universal AI credits

1 Application Assistant sample use

5.2 Immediate purchase option

A user may purchase Plus or Pro:

During signup

Immediately after onboarding

At any time from within the app

Once payment is successful:

Tier is updated via billing webhook

The client never sets or modifies tier values directly

5.3 Starter initial experience

If the user does not subscribe:

They remain in the Starter tier

They can use AI until credits are exhausted

They receive a weekly AI credit refresh

They receive 1 Application Assistant sample use

They do not receive Resume Builder access

They do not receive Life Plan regeneration access unless purchased individually

5.4 Trial offer trigger

When a Starter user hits a meaningful limit, such as:

AI credits exhausted

Attempting to use locked premium tools

The system presents an upgrade modal with the following options:

Upgrade to Plus

Upgrade to Pro

Start 7-Day ProLite Trial

If the user starts the trial:

A payment method is required and validated

tier becomes trial server-side

Trial start and end timestamps are recorded

5.5 ProLite 7-Day Trial behavior

During the trial period:

AI access is enabled but throttled

Application Assistant is enabled for a total of 3 uses

Life Plan regeneration is enabled for 1 regeneration

Resume Builder remains locked

Trial usage does not reset during the trial period

5.6 Trial end behavior (locked)

At the end of the 7-day trial period:

If the user did not cancel the trial:

The user is automatically converted to the Plus tier at $15 per month

If the user canceled the trial before it ended:

The user is reverted to the Starter tier

All trial conversions and reversions are handled exclusively via billing webhooks.

5.7 Paid tier cancellation

If a user cancels Plus or Pro:

Access remains active until the end of the billing period

At the end of the billing period, the user reverts to Starter

User data is not deleted upon cancellation

6. Tier entitlements and usage rules
6.1 Life Plan access

Starter users:

Receive 1 Life Plan generation upon onboarding completion

Do not receive included Life Plan regenerations

Trial users:

Receive 4 Life Plan regenerations per month

Pro users:

Receive 8 Life Plan regenerations per month

All tiers may purchase additional Life Plan regenerations at $2.99 per regeneration.

Life Plan regeneration limits exist to prevent abuse and excessive AI load.

6.2 AI chat usage

Starter users:

Receive 10 AI credits per 7-day period

Each AI submission consumes 1 credit

When credits reach zero, AI is disabled until the next weekly refresh

Trial users:

AI is enabled without a visible credit counter

AI usage is throttled via:

Per-minute rate limits

Daily volume ceilings

A soft total cap across the trial period

Plus users:

AI is effectively unlimited

Soft monthly usage caps apply (approximately 500 uses)

Throttles prevent automation or abuse

Pro users:

Same as Plus, with higher ceilings (approximately 1000 uses per month)
