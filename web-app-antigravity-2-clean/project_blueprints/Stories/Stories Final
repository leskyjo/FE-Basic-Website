STORIES — FEATURE BLUEPRINT

(Community Storytelling & Social Engagement Module)

1. Feature Purpose & Strategic Role

The Stories feature is the community heartbeat of the platform.

Its purpose is to:

Give users a voice

Create authentic, relatable content

Foster connection, empathy, and inspiration

Encourage repeat engagement and community identity

Surface standout individuals for deeper brand integration (Podcast invitations)

Stories are user-generated narrative content, not short comments or posts.
They are meant to be meaningful, personal, and memorable.

2. Core Concept

A Story is a user-created post that may include:

Text

Images

Video

Or any combination of the above

Each story represents a real experience from the user’s life, such as:

Prison experiences

Personal transformation

Success milestones

Setbacks and lessons

Funny or unusual moments

Hard truths

Wins, losses, or turning points

Stories are shared with the community and designed for interaction, not passive viewing.

3. Stories Feed & Discovery
Main Stories Feed

Chronological feed (most recent by default)

Option to surface “Trending” or “Most Engaged”

Each story card shows:

User avatar / display name

Story title (optional but encouraged)

Preview snippet (first lines or thumbnail)

Media indicators (text / image / video icons)

Engagement counts (likes, comments, shares)

Interaction Types

❤️ Like

💬 Comment (threaded replies supported)

🔁 Share (internal share to other users or groups)

7. Weekly “Featured Story” Program (Podcast Integration)
Concept

Once per week:

Selection Criteria (Flexible)

Engagement (likes + comments)

Community resonance

Story quality and impact

Editorial discretion

User Experience

Invitation workflow:

Follow-up instructions handled manually or semi-automated

This creates:

8. AI-Assisted Features (Optional but Powerful)

AI should support, not dominate, this section.

AI Feature 1: “Story Polish” (Optional Pre-Publish)

User can ask AI to:

Improve clarity

Fix grammar

Improve flow

Maintain the user’s voice

AI never rewrites content without approval

AI cannot change meaning or add fictional elements

AI Feature 2: “Story Summary”

AI generates a short summary or highlight snippet

Used for:

Feed previews

Featured Story selection assistance

Summary is optional and user-visible

AI Feature 3: “Reflection Prompt” (Post-Publish)

After publishing, AI may optionally ask:

“What did this experience teach you?”

“What would you tell someone going through this now?”

Responses are optional and can be appended or ignored

AI Guardrails

AI does not judge

AI does not give legal advice

AI does not fabricate details

AI does not store personal data beyond the story itself

9. Moderation & Safety (High Level)

Report Story option

Report Comment option

Admin moderation tools (review, hide, remove)

Clear content guidelines (defined elsewhere)

No heavy censorship, but basic community safety enforced.

10. Data Model (Conceptual)

At a high level, the system should support:

Stories

Media attachments

Visibility rules

Likes

Comments

Shares

Featured status

Moderation flags

Exact schema to be defined during implementation.

11. Strategic Value Summary

Stories:

Increase daily and weekly engagement

Create emotional attachment to the platform

Generate organic, authentic content

Surface real people for podcasts and brand growth

Make the platform feel alive, not transactional

This feature is not optional fluff — it is a long-term retention engine.

12. One-Paragraph Builder Summary (For AI Context)

The Stories feature is a community-driven storytelling module where users create long-form posts using text, images, and video to share real-life experiences. Stories support likes, comments, and internal sharing, with full user control over visibility (public, private, restricted) and deletion. The feed encourages interaction and surfaces standout content, including a weekly Featured Story selected for podcast invitations. AI assistance is optional and supportive, offering content polish, summaries, and reflective prompts without altering user intent or voice.
