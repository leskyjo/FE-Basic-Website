Course Extra



COURSES SECTION — LOCKED FEATURE + AI INTERACTION SPEC
1) Courses are paid individually (not included in tiers)

Each Course is a pre-recorded product:

Video lessons + text curriculum (written curriculum)

Modules/chapters, downloadable resources if needed

Courses are not bundled into Starter/Plus/Pro.

Tiers affect AI Coach intensity and some “automation/value add” features, but not course access.

2) Upon completion: Job Placement Assistance (guaranteed)

Every time a user completes a course, you guarantee:

“We will assist you in finding a job.”

What this becomes inside the app

A Job Placement Assistance flow that triggers automatically on completion:

Auto-create a Placement Ticket (internal record)

course completed

user ZIP code

target roles unlocked by the course

constraints (schedule, travel, pay floor, etc.)

current resume status

AI Coach generates:

“Placement-ready job targets” list (local + remote if applicable)

a prioritized action plan:

3 best job types to apply for immediately

recommended employers/categories

what to fix in resume to maximize odds

The Jobs section gets:

a new “Placement Jobs” lane (curated list tied to the completed course)

User experience

They finish the course → they see:

“Your Job Placement Assistance is now active.”

A short checklist (“we’re doing this with you”).

A call-to-action:

“Generate my tailored resume for these jobs” (if allowed)

“Start applying with Application Assistant” (if allowed)

3) Certificate of Completion (FE stamp)

Upon completion of each course:

Generate a Certificate of Completion

Includes:

FE stamp/branding

User name

Course title

Completion date

Unique certificate ID (for verification later)

Where it lives

Course completion screen

User’s “My Certificates” collection in Courses

4) Live One-on-One Training (separate from courses)

You offer live 1-on-1 sessions once or twice per week

These are not included with courses

They are a separate purchase/booking flow

In-app implementation concept

A “Book 1-on-1 Coaching” button inside:

each course page

the course completion screen

the Job Placement Assistance screen

AI Coach suggests a 1-on-1 when:

the user is stuck

readiness is low

they want a faster path / accountability

5) Purchase perks: credits bundled with course purchase

When a user buys a course, they automatically receive:

1 Resume Builder credit

1 Application Assistant credit

This happens regardless of tier (unless you later decide Starter should still be blocked; but your statement implies course purchase grants credits).

Important constraint

During Trial (Pro-Lite), Resume Builder and Interview Prep remain blocked per blueprint.

So if Trial users buy a course, they can still earn credits, but they may not be able to use Resume Builder until Trial ends (or until they upgrade), depending on your blueprint logic.

This is a good upsell moment:

“You earned Resume Builder credit—unlock usage by upgrading.”

HIGH-VALUE “CAREER-ENGINE” FEATURES INSIDE COURSES
Feature 1: Skill Gap Map (Courses Home)

The default Courses home screen is not a course list; it’s:

Skills you have

Skills missing

Skills that move the needle fastest

Powered by:

Life Plan → recommended skills + job preferences

(Later) Jobs section → requirements from postings

Feature 2: Courses That Unlock Jobs

Every course can display:

“Unlocks X local job types”

“Improves match score for X opportunities”

This turns Courses into a direct employment pipeline, not self-help.

Feature 3: AI-Curated Learning Paths (Mini-tracks)

Even though courses are purchased individually, the app can present:

“Suggested path” (sequence of course purchases)

“Fast cash” path (time-to-income focus)

“Trade path” vs “office path” vs “tech path”

AI explains why, and user can accept or override.

Feature 4: Readiness Score + Difficulty Forecast

Each course shows:

“Readiness score”

Prerequisites

Suggested prep courses if needed

AI reduces overwhelm and improves completion.

Feature 5: Fast Wins Mode

Filter courses by:

Short sessions

Quick ROI skills

Certifications

Income focus

This keeps users moving and feeling progress.

Feature 6: AI Course Companion (interactive Q&A while learning)

This is locked and critical.

Inside each course module:

Ask a question about the content

“Explain it simpler”

“Give a real-world example”

“Quiz me”

“How do I use this on the job?”

This is where the course becomes alive, and where tier value is felt.

Feature 7: Course Reflection → Life Plan Update (closed loop)

On completion, AI asks 2–3 quick reflection questions:

confidence level

readiness to apply

preference shifts / constraints

AI updates:

skills confidence

job match parameters

next-steps priorities

This ensures the Life Plan stays dynamic and improves job matching accuracy over time.

AI COACH INTERACTION — TIERED BEHAVIOR (LOCKED)
Starter

Minimal AI assistance around courses:

basic recommendations

limited Q&A prompts

simple explanations

Enough to feel guided, not enough to replace Plus/Pro.

Trial (Pro-Lite)

Trial should feel strong (close to Plus), but must respect hard locks:

✅ robust course companion Q&A

✅ learning path guidance

✅ reflection + plan updates

✅ course-to-job mapping

❌ Resume Builder usage

❌ Interview Prep usage

Plus

Strong AI coaching “allowance” attached to course experience:

Rich Q&A while taking the course

Better “job unlock” mapping

Better skill gap breakdowns

Clear action plans after completion

Not unlimited; some sensible cap/credit system.

Pro

“Unlimited-feeling” AI coaching while learning:

deeper explanations

multi-step coaching threads

advanced personalization

stronger job placement strategy outputs

The Pro experience should feel like a coach that stays with them continuously.

HOW COURSES CONNECT TO THE REST OF THE APP (INTEGRATION)

Courses consume:

Life Plan “skills growth” + “job preferences”

User ZIP and constraints

(Later) job posting requirements

Courses produce:

Updated skills and confidence

Certificates

Placement Assistance triggers

Resume Builder & Application Assistant credits (from purchases)

Better job match scoring in Career Finder Studio

FINAL “LOCKED” COURSES COMPLETION FLOW (END STATE)

When a user finishes a course, the app immediately generates:

Certificate of Completion (FE stamp)

Job Placement Assistance activation + curated job list

AI Reflection → Life Plan updates

Suggested next steps:

apply to curated jobs

generate resume (if allowed)

use application assistant (if allowed)

book 1-on-1 coaching (upsell)

This is cohesive, high-value, and directly tied to income outcomes.
