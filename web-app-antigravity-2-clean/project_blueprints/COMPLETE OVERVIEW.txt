COMPLETE OVERVIEW


1) What Felon Entrepreneur is and what it’s supposed to accomplish

Felon Entrepreneur (FE) is a mobile-first web application designed to help people rebuild their lives with structure, clarity, and momentum—especially users transitioning from incarceration or rebuilding from hardship. The product’s “core promise” is:

Turn a user’s situation + goals into a personalized Life Plan (a structured roadmap).

Provide action tools (jobs, applications, resume generation, habit/discipline prompts, etc.) to execute that plan.

Monetize via a tier model (Starter → 7-day trial → paid Plus/Pro) while keeping the public website accessible for awareness and conversion.

The build is explicitly intended to be implemented as a Next.js App Router web app with Supabase (Postgres) for authentication/data, and server-controlled AI endpoints (no AI keys in the client).

2) Mobile-first requirement (and how mobile differs from desktop/tablet)
Core rule

Most users will be on phones, so the UI/UX must be optimized for mobile first. Desktop/laptop/tablet can share a “wide layout,” but mobile is not just a resized desktop—it has different navigation patterns and layout behaviors.

Navigation strategy across devices

The project defines three navigation states and device rules:

Onboarding Tunnel (No Nav)

During signup/login + onboarding steps, no global navigation is shown (mobile or desktop).

User must complete onboarding flow without distraction.

Public Marketing Website Nav

Public pages are accessible without an account.

Desktop/tablet/laptop uses a top header nav.

Mobile uses a simplified experience appropriate for phones.

In-App Nav (After onboarding)

Mobile: bottom navigation bar with: Home, Plan, FE Button (center), Jobs, Profile.

Desktop/Tablet/Laptop: top header navigation with broader tabs (including Courses and Shop).

The FE Button is central to mobile navigation and acts as a modal/overlay hub for “boost tools,” including Courses and Cheat Codes (Cheat Codes lives under Courses inside the FE Button experience).

3) The onboarding experience (the “master tunnel”)

Onboarding is treated as the “master story” that all other modules must follow:

High-level phases (conceptual)

Public landing (marketing)

Account creation / login

Onboarding flow (card-based, guided)

Questionnaire completion

Life Plan generation

Immediate post-onboarding dashboard state

Starter usage → upgrade triggers → trial → paid tiers

Onboarding steps (defined as card-based flow)

The onboarding blueprint defines a multi-card sequence that includes:

Welcome/introduction cards (purpose, mindset framing, expectations)

A Life Plan Questionnaire (your zip includes “FINAL v3 (20 QUESTIONS)” organized by cards)

Submission triggers Life Plan creation

After onboarding completion, user is routed into the app with correct nav state

Auth + Profile behavior (Supabase)

Uses Supabase Auth for identity.

A profiles row is created/maintained for the user.

onboarding_step is used to enforce correct routing:

Users cannot bypass steps by URL manipulation.

If partially complete, they get routed back into the correct onboarding card/page.

4) Tier structure, 7-day trial, and entitlements (access control)

The tier canon in this project is:

Tier states (exact set)

A user is always in exactly one state:

Starter (Free)

Trial (7-Day ProLite universal trial)

Plus (Paid)

Pro (Paid)

Trial behavior

Trial is offered when a Starter user hits meaningful limits (e.g., AI credits exhausted or attempts locked tools).

Trial is time-limited (7 days) and enforced server-side.

Tier changes are handled via billing webhooks (authoritative source of truth).

Core entitlements (examples pulled from the tier blueprint)

Life Plan

Starter: 1 Life Plan generation after onboarding; no included regenerations

Trial: 1 Life Plan regeneration during trial

Plus: 4 regenerations/month

Pro: 8 regenerations/month

Additional regenerations purchasable per use

Resume Builder

Starter: locked

Trial: locked

Plus: 5 generations/month

Pro: 10 generations/month

Application Assistant

Starter: 1 sample use (initial experience)

Plus: 15 assisted applications/month

Pro: 30 assisted applications/month

Jobs module

Starter: limited saves and basic scoring/insights

Pro: more saves and deeper scoring + “next best jobs” suggestions

Interview practice

Pro-only

UI requirements for tier gating

Always show a tier badge inside the app:

Starter / Trial (with days remaining) / Plus / Pro

Locked features remain visible but show:

Lock icon

Short explanation (“Available on Plus or Pro”)

Upgrade CTA (call-to-action)

Usage meters must exist for:

AI credits/usage

Resume generations

Application Assistant uses

Life Plan regenerations

On mobile, usage meters should use stacked UI, sheets, or compact cards (not dense tables).

5) Core modules and what each page/feature does
A) Home (Dashboard concept)

The blueprints reference a post-onboarding “dashboard behavior,” including:

Immediate “in-app” state after Life Plan generation

Visible tier status and upgrade prompts when limits are reached

Quick entry points to Plan / Jobs / FE Button tools

(Your zip is module-heavy; Home is more implicit, but it is the app’s primary landing after onboarding.)

B) Plan tab (Life Plan module)

The Plan blueprint establishes Plan as the core identity feature of FE.

Typical Plan capabilities:

Display the user’s current Life Plan (structured sections)

Support limited regeneration of Life Plan based on tier rules

Store plan versions/history (or at minimum the latest plan plus metadata)

Gate regeneration and advanced “Plan tools” behind Plus/Pro and/or per-use purchases

AI behavior:

Life Plan generation is triggered after questionnaire submission.

Regeneration must be server-controlled and rate-limited.

C) Jobs tab

The Jobs blueprint defines a job exploration and action system that includes:

Job browsing/search + filters (mobile-friendly filter UI)

Job result cards and job detail views

Saved jobs (tier-based limits)

AI job insights and scoring (tier-based depth)

Application support features that connect to the Application Assistant entitlements

D) Courses (separate top-level tab on desktop; also reachable via FE Button)

Courses is a structured content catalog with:

Course listing and detail experiences

Enrollment/locked content behavior based on tier

Upgrade prompts where access is gated

Server-authoritative entitlement checks

Important structural requirement from your project direction:
Courses must also be accessible from the FE Button hub (mobile-first reality), even if it exists as a full tab in the desktop header navigation.

E) FE Button (center hub on mobile)

The FE Button blueprint defines a central, glowing, always-available action hub in the mobile bottom nav. It opens an overlay that contains “boost tools” (quick wins and high-impact helpers).

It is designed to:

Surface motivational and execution tools

Provide tier-aware access to premium boosts

Be fast and thumb-friendly on mobile

It explicitly includes:

Courses

Cheat Codes (as a section under Courses inside the FE Button experience)

F) Cheat Codes (micro-paid “life hacks” video store inside FE Button > Courses)

Cheat Codes is a dedicated section (card + possible standalone page) that provides:

A catalog of short, high-value “life hack” videos

Each item has:

A teaser/preview

A price (generally $2–$10 per video)

A purchase flow

Post-purchase full access

Multiple creator types:

Founders (you/Nate)

Approved users/creators

Potential AI-generated/assisted content (but still must be controlled and reviewed if you want consistent brand trust)

This is effectively a microtransaction content marketplace inside the FE ecosystem.

G) Shop tab (merchandise)

Shop is a standard ecommerce experience for physical goods (merch), supported by the merch image assets in the zip.

Defined pages include:

Shop listing

Product detail

Cart

Checkout flow (typically Stripe)

Shipping + policies content

Confirmation + receipt emails

This is intentionally a simpler “standard ecommerce page,” but must still meet security/compliance requirements.

H) Profile

Profile is responsible for:

User account information

Tier status + billing management entry points

Usage meters and limits visibility

Possibly saved data: saved jobs, plan metadata, course progress, purchases (cheat codes/merch)

6) Data model overview (Supabase Postgres)

Your blueprints strongly imply these core tables/entities (minimum viable):

Identity & Access

auth.users (Supabase managed)

profiles

user_id (FK to auth.users)

onboarding_step

tier_state (Starter/Trial/Plus/Pro)

trial_start, trial_end

usage counters / quotas (or usage tracked in separate tables)

Life Plan

life_plan_responses (questionnaire answers; raw structured responses)

life_plans

current plan content (structured JSON or text)

versioning fields (optional but recommended)

created_at, updated_at

life_plan_regenerations (ledger of regeneration usage)

Jobs

jobs_cache (optional, depending on job sourcing strategy)

saved_jobs

job_insights (AI scoring/explanations)

Resume Builder

resumes

resume_generations (usage ledger)

Application Assistant

applications

application_assistant_uses (usage ledger)

Courses

courses

lessons

enrollments

course_progress

Shop + Cheat Codes commerce

products (merch + cheat code SKUs, or separate product types)

orders

order_items

payments

entitlements (who owns what: purchased cheat codes, course unlocks, etc.)

Billing

subscriptions

billing_events (webhook receipts / audit trail)

Key architectural principle: tier and entitlement decisions must be derived from server-side truth (DB + billing webhooks), not client state.

7) Security requirements (must-have, builder-facing)

This project repeatedly emphasizes “security-first,” especially around AI, auth, and paid access.

A) Authentication & session security

Supabase Auth with secure session handling

Email verification + password reset flows

Brute-force and abuse mitigation:

rate limiting on auth endpoints

login attempt throttling

Optional future: “new device login alerts”

B) Row-Level Security (RLS)

Implement Supabase RLS (Row-Level Security) so users can only access:

their own profile

their own plan and questionnaire responses

their own saved jobs, resumes, applications

their own purchases and entitlements

C) Server-authoritative entitlements

No premium gating on the client alone.

Every privileged operation must check:

tier_state

remaining quotas

entitlement flags (purchases/unlocks)

trial validity (time remaining)

D) AI security (critical)

Clients never call AI providers directly

AI keys are never shipped to browsers

All AI calls are made through server routes with:

authentication required

entitlement + quota checks

rate limiting per user

audit logging (who called what, when, and why)

E) Payments and webhooks

Stripe (or equivalent) with webhook verification

Webhooks are the source of truth for subscription state transitions

Prevent forged tier upgrades by:

verifying webhook signatures

storing webhook event IDs

enforcing idempotency (don’t double-apply events)

F) General web security baseline

Input validation everywhere (forms, query params, uploads)

Output encoding (protect against XSS (cross-site scripting))

CSRF protections where applicable

Secure headers (CSP (content security policy), HSTS (strict transport security), etc.)

Logging + monitoring for abuse patterns (especially AI endpoints)

8) Email/notification expectations (high-level)

The blueprints include emails/notifications such as:

Welcome / verification email (auth)

Password reset

Purchase receipts (Shop + Cheat Codes)

Possibly upgrade/trial prompts (product messaging)

Optional future security alerts (new login/device)

Implementation should use a transactional email provider and log email events (sent, failed) for support.

9) Content and assets included in the project.zip

Your zip includes:

Merch images (Shop catalog assets)

Logos and app images (brand assets)

Founder images (for About/identity/credibility usage)

Full text blueprints for:

Onboarding

Nav layout rules

Tier & access enforcement

Plan

Jobs

Courses

Shop

FE Button

Cheat Codes

Life Plan questionnaire (20 questions)

10) Build intent (what the AI builder should implement)

When you hand this overview to an AI builder, the “non-negotiables” it must respect are:

Mobile-first UI with a distinct mobile navigation model (bottom nav + FE Button hub).

Onboarding tunnel has no nav and is enforced by routing + onboarding_step.

Life Plan generation is the core feature triggered by questionnaire submission.

Tier system is canonical: Starter → 7-day Trial → Plus/Pro with strict entitlements.

All AI calls are server-side only with tier/quota checks + rate limits + logs.

Supabase RLS must be used to prevent cross-user data access.

Billing webhooks drive tier state (not client flags).

Courses and Cheat Codes must be accessible inside the FE Button hub, with Cheat Codes functioning as micro-paid videos ($2–$10) with teaser → purchase → unlock.
