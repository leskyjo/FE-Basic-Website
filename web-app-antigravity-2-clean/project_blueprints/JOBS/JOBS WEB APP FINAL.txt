WEB_BLUEPRINT — JOBS TAB

(FELON ENTREPRENEUR WEB APP — MOBILE-FIRST)

This blueprint defines the Jobs tab experience for the Felon Entrepreneur web application.
It is fully aligned with the Onboarding Overview and Tiers & Access blueprints.

This document is written so it can be used to derive builder-ready prompts for:

Frontend (Next.js App Router + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)

Backend (Next.js Route Handlers + Supabase)

Database schema (Supabase Postgres + RLS (Row-Level Security))

Tier enforcement, quotas, and throttling

Security, abuse prevention, and auditability

Admin tooling and future reporting

0. Role of the Jobs Tab (Web App Context)

The Jobs tab is where Felon Entrepreneur converts Life Plan data into income.

The Jobs tab must:

Turn Life Plan insights + FE Resume data into high-signal job matches

Reduce friction for users who struggle with forms, systems, and bureaucracy

Respect justice-impacted realities (felon-friendly awareness and filtering)

Clearly demonstrate the value of Plus and Pro tiers without blocking Starter users from opportunity

Everything in Jobs exists to help users get hired faster and smarter, not to browse endlessly.

Relationship to other app areas

Plan Tab
Supplies skills, schedule constraints, goals, and environment data used for job ranking and “Matches Your Life Plan” indicators.

FE Button
Hosts learning, readiness content, and career skills that reinforce job success.

Profile / Settings
Holds tier, trial status, subscription controls, and billing access.

Onboarding
ZIP code and location feed default job search location.

1. Routes, Navigation, and Access
1.1 Routes (App Router)

All Jobs features live inside the authenticated (app) route group and are only available to logged-in, onboarded users.

/jobs — Main Jobs Hub (search, results, tools overview)

/jobs/[jobId] — Job detail view (page or modal route)

/jobs/saved — Saved jobs (“My Jobs”)

/jobs/resumes — Resume list and management

/jobs/resumes/new — Resume Builder flow

/jobs/application-assistant — Application Assistant flow

/jobs/interview-prep — Interview Prep flow

Modal routes may be used in later phases; MVP can use full-page routes.

1.2 Navigation
Mobile (Primary)

Global bottom navigation bar:

Left: Home → /dashboard

Left-center: Plan → /plan

Center: Elevated FE Button (opens FE menu)

Right-center: Jobs (active)

Right: Profile → /profile

Tapping Jobs always navigates to /jobs.

Desktop / Tablet

Top navigation bar:

Home | Plan | FE | Jobs | Profile (plus logo)

When Jobs is active, /jobs content fills the main layout with multi-column layouts at larger breakpoints.

1.3 Access Control & Gating

Only authenticated users with completed onboarding can access /jobs.

On request to any /jobs route:

No Supabase session → redirect to /login

Onboarding incomplete → redirect to next onboarding step

Tier data is read from:

profiles.tier

profiles.subscription_status

profiles.trial_started_at / profiles.trial_ends_at

There is no plan_tier or tool-specific tier field.
