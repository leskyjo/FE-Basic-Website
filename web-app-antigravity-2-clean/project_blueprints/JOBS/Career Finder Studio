Career Finder Studio


Career Finder Studio (Jobs): high-value features to implement
1) Dual-input matching (Life Plan + “Career Intent Box”)

This is your “job description box” idea, expanded into a deliberate mechanism:

A. Life Plan signal (default ON)

Uses life_plan.feature_slices.jobs + work_money.job_preferences (roles, constraints, keywords).

Prevents random matches and “browse hell.”

B. Career Intent Box (user-controlled)

A text box: “Describe what you want to do (or what you’ve done).”

AI converts it into structured intent:

target roles, industries, must-have conditions, deal-breakers, keywords, seniority

The user can “lock” constraints (example: “no nights,” “no travel,” “must be within 20 miles”).

Why it’s high value

People often don’t know job titles. They can describe what they want, and the system translates it into a search strategy.

2) “Skills & Proof Card” beside search (your idea, made powerful)

A small card next to search (or a collapsible drawer on mobile) with:

“Skills I have” (chips + free text)

“Work I’ve done” (1–3 short bullets per job)

“Credentials” (licenses, certs, OSHA, ServSafe, CDL, etc.)

“Proof links” (portfolio links if relevant)

AI turns this into:

Skill taxonomy (normalized skills)

Keywords for ATS (Applicant Tracking System—resume screening software)

Missing skills for target roles (gap analysis)

This card becomes reusable across:

Jobs matching

Resume Builder

Application Assistant

Courses recommendations

3) Job Match Score (0–100) with explainability (not a black box)

You’re right to want a score. The critical piece is: make it explainable so the user trusts it.

Score components (example)

Fit (0–40): role alignment vs Life Plan + Career Intent

Skills match (0–25): overlap of required/preferred skills vs user skills/resume

Constraints match (0–15): schedule, distance, pay floor, remote/on-site, physical requirements

Eligibility risk (0–10): background checks / licensing / degree gating (if detectable)

Competitiveness (0–10): seniority mismatch, under/over-qualified signals

Each job card shows:

“Match Score: 82”

2–4 “Because” bullets:

“Matches your target roles: Warehouse Lead / Logistics”

“You have 7/9 required skills”

“Within 12 miles of your ZIP”

“No degree required”

“Improve my score” button

AI suggests exact actions:

“Add forklift certification (if you have it)”

“Rewrite bullet #2 to include inventory management keywords”

“Take Course X to cover skill gap Y”

This is one of the biggest “wow” moments you can build.

4) Felon-friendly intelligence (real value, handled responsibly)

Your blueprint has a “felon-friendly filter.” You can make it significantly more useful:

Felon-friendly confidence label (not absolute truth):

“Likely friendly”

“Unknown”

“Likely strict”

Based on:

job posting language (background check mentions, “bondable,” etc.)

employer category and historical user feedback (later)

user-specific flags (if user chooses to store them)

This must be framed carefully:

“We can’t guarantee employer policy. This is an estimate.”

5) Feedback loop: “Did you apply?” “Did you get a response?”

Every job card can collect 1-tap feedback:

Saved

Applied

Interview

Rejected

Hired

This creates:

Better ranking over time

Proof of progress for the Plan tab

Data to generate weekly “Momentum Reports”

6) “Two-lane results”: Safe picks vs Stretch picks

Instead of one list:

Best Matches (Safe Picks): high probability, low friction

Stretch Matches: bigger pay/title but requires steps

Users love this because it feels strategic, not random.

7) “Job-to-Resume Fit Preview” (Plus/Pro)

When a job is selected:

AI shows a quick preview:

“Your resume currently matches 63% of this posting.”

“Top missing keywords: X, Y, Z.”

One click: “Generate Resume Tailored to This Job.”

This ties Jobs → Resume Builder directly.

8) “One-click Apply Kit”

A job gets an “Apply Kit” bundle:

Resume (tailored)

Cover letter (optional)

60-second “pitch script” (for phone calls or video cover letter)

“Application Answers Pack” (from Application Assistant)

This is high perceived value because users walk away with deliverables, not just listings.

9) “Search modes” that feel like a studio

Make it fun without gimmicks:

Mode: Quick Match (fast, minimal input)

Mode: Deep Match (uses Life Plan + Skills Card + Intent Box + Resume)

Mode: No Experience (filters for entry-level + no degree + training)

Mode: Fast Cash (short onboarding: immediate hire categories + weekly pay emphasis)

10) Trust & safety details (must-have)

Clear “Why this match?” explanation

Transparent scoring

Ability to hide sensitive factors

“Private Mode” toggle: prevents storing certain notes (especially justice-impacted info)

Modern resume expectations (2024–2025 reality you need to design around)

These are the practical expectations your AI resume system should optimize for:

ATS-friendly formatting is still the default requirement
Clean structure, minimal styling, predictable headings, keyword alignment.

Keyword alignment matters because screening is increasingly automated
Tools and recruiters emphasize mirroring job-description language where truthful.

File type is not universal: DOCX is often safer than PDF in ATS workflows
Many ATS systems parse DOCX more reliably; PDF is fine only when the employer explicitly supports it.

Portfolios/links are expected in many modern/creative/technical roles
A portfolio link is a common differentiator (design, UX, front-end, marketing).

Short video intros / video cover letters are an emerging “edge,” not a universal norm
Useful in communication-heavy roles; not always advisable; should be optional and user-approved.

Implication for your Resume Builder
You should generate two “tracks”:

ATS Track (default): clean DOCX/PDF, no graphics, keyword-optimized, job-tailored

Proof Track (optional add-ons): portfolio links, project highlights, optional video link, case studies

Tier mapping (practical, aligned with your blueprint)

Your blueprint already defines monthly quotas. For “fun + value,” the gating should feel fair:

Starter

Job search + filters + match scoring (basic)

Intent Box (limited)

Saved jobs

“Why this match?” explanations

Limited AI “Improve my score” (using your global credit system)

Trial (Pro-Lite)

Same as Starter for tools (per blueprint), but you can preview locked features:

“Resume-powered matching preview” (blurred / sample)

“Apply Kit preview”

Plus

Resume-powered matching ON

Resume Builder (monthly quota)

Application Assistant (quota)

Interview Prep (quota)

Deeper scoring + “Improve my score” fully enabled

Pro

Same as Plus with higher quotas + “deep match mode” enhancements:

multi-variant resume generation (your 2 vs 4 versions concept fits here well)

more aggressive tailoring and optimization cycles
