LANDING PAGE DESIGN AND ONBOARDING



1.1 Public visitor experience (logged out)

A logged-out visitor sees one single page only:

GET / → Public Landing Page 

Onboarding Overview 100% Final


And that landing page has:

No app navigation

No access to tools or AI

Only marketing + education + CTAs that lead to account creation 

Onboarding Overview 100% Final

1.2 What happens if they try to access app pages while logged out

If they try /dashboard /plan /jobs (Career Studio) /courses /etc. while logged out:

Redirect to / with messaging, or

Show a minimal gate that routes to /login or /signup 

Onboarding Overview 100% Final

Important clarification: This does not mean the landing page shows those app nav links. It means that if someone deep-links or types a URL, your route guard (middleware (server rule that intercepts requests)) kicks them back out.

1.3 Onboarding tunnel rule (after signup/login)

During onboarding, there is:

No bottom nav

No header nav

No direct access to app sections

Only minimal FE branding + step controls 

Onboarding Overview 100% Final

This is critical: onboarding must feel like a focused “guided tunnel,” not a website.

2) Landing Page Blueprint (Public, Marketing-Only, High-Converting)
Overall visual identity (matches your reference images)

Background: primarily black, with subtle animated gradient washes (deep red + near-black) and occasional “cinematic texture” overlays (very faint).

Card style: glassmorphism (frosted-glass look) panels with soft inner glow edges (red/white), clean separators, premium spacing.

Motion: slow parallax (background drift), gentle fade-ins, crisp hover states (desktop), and smooth section transitions.

Typography: bold, condensed-feeling headlines; high contrast white; red accents for emphasis.

Conversion emphasis: every major section ends with a large primary CTA button.

2.1 Structure at the top (exact order you required)
A) Header (minimal, conversion-only)

Per the doc, do this exactly:

Left: FE logo (click → /)

Right: two buttons:

Log In (secondary) → /login

Join Free (primary) → /signup

No other nav items, no hamburger, no tabs 

Onboarding Overview 100% Final

B) Headline Block (first thing under header)

This is your “big, bold, strong words” section. It must be visible immediately, above the fold.

Layout:

Big headline (H1)

Short sub-headline (H2/H3)

Two CTAs side-by-side (desktop) / stacked (mobile):

Primary: Start My Life Plan → /signup

Secondary: Log In → /login

Example headline options (pick one later; structure stays the same):

“Your past isn’t the end. It’s the beginning.”

“Turn your record into your résumé.”

“Build a real life plan. Then execute it.”

“Get out. Get focused. Get paid.”

(We can refine copy later, but this is the required top-of-page format.)

C) Hero Intro Video (immediately under headline)

Per your requirement, the first major media element is a badass introduction video.

Hero video behavior:

Autoplays muted (desktop + mobile), with captions (because most users watch muted).

Big “cinematic” overlay text moments (short phrases that punctuate the message).

Ends with a strong CTA overlay:

Join Free

“Start your Life Plan Questionnaire in minutes.”

Hero supporting images (optional but recommended):

1–2 supporting images under the video or as side-panels on desktop:

“Success story vibe” imagery, premium, aspirational, consistent with brand tone.

These images must not distract; they reinforce.

Key rule: This hero area is not “busy.” It’s: headline → video → clear CTA.

3) Landing Page Feature Sections (Cards on Mobile, Containers on Desktop)

This is the core of what you asked for: each feature gets a dedicated section that looks “fire.”

Global pattern for every feature section

Each section includes (in some order, mixed up slightly per section so it doesn’t feel copy/paste):

Feature Title (short)

Power Headline (strong, emotional, direct)

High-powered marketing copy (brief but punchy)

Video (you/Nate, or cinematic product teaser)

Images (screenshots/mockups/visual metaphors)

CTA button (always)

Optional: micro-proof (numbers, quick bullets, testimonial snippet)

Important: even though the layout varies section to section, every section must still clearly contain those ingredients.

4) Required Landing Page Sections (In Recommended Order)

Below is the full, detailed landing page in the order I recommend for highest conversion.

Section 1 — “What Felon Entrepreneur Is” (Fast clarity)

Title: The FE Hub
Headline: “The tools, the shortcuts, and the edge.”

This section visually matches your FE glow vibe (from your nav image), but it is presented as a “feature hub,” not clickable nav.
