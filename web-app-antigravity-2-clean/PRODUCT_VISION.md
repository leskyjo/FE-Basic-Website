## 📝 TERMINOLOGY UPDATES

**OLD → NEW:**
- "Life Plan" → **"Career Plan"** (or "Master Plan"? "Life Blueprint"?)
- "Jobs" → **"Career Finder Studio"**
- Keep: "BMB (Build My Business)"
- Keep: "BMC (Build My Career)"

**Suggestions for Career Plan alternatives:**
- Master Plan (too generic?)
- Life Blueprint (sounds architectural)
- Success Roadmap (too corporate?)
- **Career Plan** (clear, specific to primary focus)

**Recommendation:** Use **"Career Plan"** as primary, but each specialized plan has its own name:
- Career Plan (employment/business)
- Wellness Plan (health)
- Money Plan or Financial Plan
- Resources Plan
- Learning Plan or Education Plan

---

## 🔄 NEXT STEPS

1. **Update COMPLETE_TIER_STRUCTURE.md** with all features in ProTeams onboarding
2. **Create BLUEPRINT_CHECKLIST.md** for cross-referencing
3. **Update PIVOT_PLAN.md** with multi-plan architecture
4. **Create master implementation roadmap** (phases 1-4 detailed)
5. **Start Phase 1 implementation** (MVP features)
